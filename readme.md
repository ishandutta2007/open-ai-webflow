## What is OpenFlow?

OpenFlow is a no-code/low-code platform that empowers you to design, build, and deploy sophisticated web applications visually. It merges the best features of leading platforms like **Webflow, WeWeb, Bubble, and Softr** with the intelligent capabilities of AI tools like **Lindy AI and Flowise**. Whether you're creating a simple landing page, a complex marketplace, or an internal tool, OpenFlow provides the flexibility and power you need to bring your ideas to life—without writing a single line of code.

## Why OpenFlow?

The digital landscape is evolving. AI is no longer a novelty but a fundamental part of modern workflows. OpenFlow is built on this principle, integrating AI at every step of the development process.

- **Unify Your Workflow:** Stop juggling multiple tools. OpenFlow brings together a powerful visual editor, a flexible data backend, and AI-powered assistance in one seamless experience.
- **Build for the AI Era:** From generating UI components with a simple prompt to creating complex backend logic with natural language, OpenFlow is designed for the way we build today.
- **Truly Open Source:** No vendor lock-in. No hidden fees. OpenFlow is built by the community, for the community. Host it yourself, customize it to your needs, and contribute to its future.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Built on a modern, robust stack, OpenFlow is ready to scale with your projects. Connect to any data source, integrate with your favorite tools, and build applications that grow with your business.

## Core Features

- **Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor:** A pixel-perfect, intuitive canvas that gives you complete control over your design.
- **AI-Powered Design:** Generate entire sections, suggest color palettes, and create responsive layouts with simple text prompts.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Build with reusable components, ensuring consistency and speeding up your development process.
- **Flexible Data Backends:** Connect to any REST or GraphQL API, integrate with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, or use our built-in database to get started quickly.
- **AI-Powered Logic:** Create complex workflows and backend logic using a visual builder or natural language.
- **One-Click Deployment:** Deploy your application to your own infrastructure or a managed service with a single click.
- **Extensible and Customizable:** As an open-source platform, OpenFlow is designed to be extended. Create your own components, add new integrations, and tailor the platform to your specific needs.
